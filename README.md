Python OpenCV Experiments Repository
Welcome to the Python OpenCV Experiments repository! This repository contains code files and examples demonstrating basic operations and experiments using the OpenCV library in Python. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library that provides a wide range of tools for image and video analysis.


- Introduction
In this repository, you will find a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that cover a variety of experiments and basic operations using OpenCV. These experiments are designed to help you get started with image processing, computer vision, and understanding the capabilities of OpenCV.

- Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system. You can install OpenCV using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
# It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.

- Experiments
Experiment 1: Expression Masking
In this experiment, you will learn how to apply masking on an image using OpenCV and display it.

Experiment 2: Histogram Generation
In this experiment, you will learn how to generate a Histogram of an image using OpenCV and display it.

Experiment 3: Black and White Dot Detection
In this experiment, you will learn how to detect dots in an image, using thresholding and counting them using OpenCV and display them.

Experiment 4: CDF-PDF Generation
In this experiment, you will learn how to generate CDF and PDF plots of an image using OpenCV and display them.

Experiment 5: Image Transformation
In this experiment, you will learn how to use linear, bitwise, gray, and thresholding transformation of an image using OpenCV and display it.

Experiment 6: Coming Soon
